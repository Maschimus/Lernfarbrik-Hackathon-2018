# Kinemic Android Example / Starter
This project is an example android application which shows how to interact with the [Kinemic Publisher](https://kinemic.de/evalpackage.html).

The easiest way to get started is to simply clone this project and use it as a template for a new application.
If you want to integrate gesture interaction into your existing application, use our [Toolbox](https://github.com/kinemic/kinemic-toolbox-android).


# Application
The first activity (`MainActivity`) simply listens to publisher events and updates UI elements as a response to events.
The 'Rotate RL' gesture opens a drawing activity (`MouseEventActivity`) which shows you how to use the airmouse feature.

The code contains some comments which explain what's going on. For more detailed information see our [Toolbox](https://github.com/kinemic/kinemic-toolbox-android).

# Trainer
If you need help with the gestures, visit our online [Trainer](http://kinemic.com/gesture-trainer-dev). Simply connect it to your Kinemic Publisher using the Settings page and you are ready to start!
